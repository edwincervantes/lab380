1 password hash cracked, 0 left


pass1-3
finding test eax, eax I found out this sets the zero flag if they are equal
With a JNZ next the value had to be set do zero and that is how the password is compared.
Seeing earlier we used the mov instruction to move the contents of "text" to register eax.
Password: We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

First thing I noticed was the movzx instruction of byte_4302.
