C and Assembly pt 3 notes:

Use IDA on host machine but compile all code through VM, use shared folder for this located in /vagrant/src/

Use i86 notes for this to see notations.

Comments are made on lines by presssing ;

When opening on IDA open binary file which does not have a . extension

Pack database before exiting so all work is saved.

Branch is taken on green arrows (if, else)

loc is location of a jump

when you see a jump jz or jnz, it means a conditional statement(if, etc..)
