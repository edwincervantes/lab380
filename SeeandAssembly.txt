a03 - Not sure how variables are being declared. Pretty sure I have the amount of 
variables correct and types of aritmetic ops correct. Current thoughts...Maybe it had something to do with main().

a05 - Messed up the shl instruction. I could shl once but didn't know how twice 
looks like in C, plus there is another additive function at the end.

b08 - Got it to match binary except there is one different function called before returning 0 in the one I created?
Not to sure why, may have to do with using default case
