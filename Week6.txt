a) First get IP address of Kali-clone and try to ping it from Kali

Kali -

Kali-rolling: ether 08:00:27:23:1a:fa  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)

Kali-clone: ether 08:00:27:de:de:94  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)

Metasploitable2: Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:27:cc:8e

No ARP entry for 172.28.128.3
HPING 172.28.128.3 (eth1 172.28.128.3): S set, 40 headers + 0 data bytes

a)Everytime a ping is sent to the attacking machine, the attacking machine recieves the ping.

b)These are ARP request packets

c)Kali-clone is sending a ping out to kali requesting to know who it is through ARP packets.
These packets are being recorded from the tcpdump being ran on the kali VM

5)
a)There is a lot of talking back and forth between the targer (kali-clone) and the webserver(metasploitable2)

c)The entries are different. Now the webserver and the target are talking back and forth and have each other's MAC addresses

This means that from my attacking kali machine I can see how the target VM is talking to the webserver

b)After I stopped the attack there was nothing for the TCP dump to detect so no new packets came through and showed in the table


8)
a)I have the same browser paged pulled up and can see what they're viewing from my attacking VM


9)
a)It is impacted during the attack but not in real time it is slightly delayed
