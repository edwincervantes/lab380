Week 1

Vagrant - Helps control VMs, we will be using this to manage Oracle's VMs

*Before the start of the course I had already downloaded and installed Oracle VM and Vagrant
	NOTE: Linux apt library only has Vagrant 1.8.1. Use wget to get latest version
Went over notes on what Cybersecurity is and what it means to be a hacker, check Canvas for videos and notes


***Lab: Set Up PentestEnv***

* Xavier's bandwidth is to slow to download VM's during classtime so I followed PDF instructions of assignment at home.

* Ran into problems using Vagrant trying to open 2 VMs at the same time. (Kali is fine)

* Reason is because I use 'sudo' on 'vagrant up' command. This made all files I created under ownership of the root user, giving me a permission denied error.
	ie: Vagrant needs to be owned by local user

* Fixed permissions with help from Mr. Rowland
	$sudo chown -R edwin:edwin ~/.vagrant.d/
	$sudo chown -R edwin:edwin ~/380lab/pentest-env/vagrant/machines

*After this vagrant rebuilt the machines to be owned by local user

*Copy machines over----- $cp examples/csci380.pentestrc .pentestrc

*If problems will arise because you were messing with the GUI and vagrant and youre locked from things try $vagrant destroy "name"
