*******Look at Canvas pages for assignments coressponding to answers********

-I feel as if I can do the material and know the material better than what my grade reflects.
The reason for this is a few careless mistakes on my end by not submitting assignments on time or forgetting to do the reading.
Since then I have really tried strapping down because I know I can get a high grade in this class

The class was moving a little slow at the beginning of the year but now I feel that it
is moving at a good pace. I have work to take home now and do so I can revisit the material more than just once a week in class.

The topics I understand best are scanning Networks because there are so many different tools you can use to find the same thing.
The topic I understand the least is assembly right now, I've written in assembly (MIPS)  before but the .s files we produce from our gcc compiler is just so much more different looking.

In class I would find it more helpful if people could do troubleshooting on their own instead of asking the professor for every little thing that goes wrong, we're computer scientist we should be able to fix most of our own problems.
